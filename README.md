EventsDrive
===========

EventsDrive is a Social Events App offering auto sync any event related Files-Repository to your Google Drive in a seamless way.
First introduced in Google Drive Hackathon (GDG Israel) Tel-Aviv August 2012.

I've used Apigee.com as our Server-Side Platform.

Currently, the source is still FULL of example code from Apigee's Android Sample App.
